# Infotech 1600 Final Project

For my final project I will be going over Intrusion Investigation 


# Digital Forensics
Intrusion investigation is a key concept in working with digital forensics as it is key to any professional that works in the field to have a base knowledge on what to do once an intrusion has occurred.

## Incident Response

The first step towards investigating an incident will be to follow the incident response plan that your company or work place creates. This will typically include having methods to stop the intruder to create further damage by quarantining the site of attack, then reporting the intrusion. If your work place does not already have an incident response plan it will be crucial that you help develop one with detailed steps to follow.

## Incident Response plan

Within an Incident response plan (IRP) you typically will have 8 different steps. These steps are plan, identify, test, communicate, engage, conduct, establish and continue. From planning to testing that will be before an attack occurs, from communicating and engaging that will be during an attack and afterwards will be following after the attack.

Here is a better visual aid to help better understand.


## In conclusion
Creating a IRP and being aware of what potential action can save an organization a tremendous amount of time and resources if implemented correctly. This has been apparent in  the past year or two with the uptick of attacks that are taking place on organizations. I hope this assignment could help others learn what to do in these situations
